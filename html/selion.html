  <h1 class="page-header">What is SeLion?</h1>
  <p>
      In 2010 we embarked on a journey to replace our old "record and playback" test software with a
      Java native test framework that promoted best practices and could scale across complex flows and multiple
      languages. The result? A <b>Selenium WebDriver-based</b> framework that slowly evolved into what we're introducing as
      <b>SeLion</b> (pronounced "sea lion"). We've spent years making improvements, fixing bugs, and generally
      learning from our mistakes. In fact we've re-architected the code at least twice. We're at the point now where
      we're pretty happy with the results and we're taking it to the Selenium community by request.
  </p>
  <h2>Why use SeLion?</h2>
  <p>
      Let's say you have a complicated website with all sorts of pages and flows, and it is changed CONSTANTLY by an army
      of developers in multiple locations AND your website is rendered in about three dozen languages. Your boss
      comes to  you and says "Hey, we need to test all this stuff, but the automated test cases need to be easily
      maintainable and the people writing the tests shouldn't have to do a ton of coding. By the way, it
      needs to be in Java."
  </p>
  <p>
      Enter <b>SeLion</b>. Front-end automation made less difficult. We don't like the word "easy" because the most powerful tools
      are not push-button easy. In fact, if you're looking for a tool to do all your automation for you in five
      easy steps with no programming experience necessary, we can direct you to a myriad of "record and playback"
      test frameworks that are easy to set up and impress your friends and colleagues. It's been our experience
      that these "easy" solutions are cumbersome to maintain once you reach about 800 test cases or so. When you hit
      5,000 test cases, then you really start to feel the burn.
  </p>
  <h2>What's in SeLion?</h2>
  <p>
      SeLion uses Selenium <b><a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/">WebDriver</a></b>,
      <b><a href="http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/">ios-driver</a></b>,
      <b><a href="http://selendroid.io/">Selendroid</a></b>,
      <b><a href="https://github.com/appium">appium</a></b>,
      <b><a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a></b> and
      <b><a href="http://testng.org/doc/index.html">TestNG</a></b> underneath the hood.
  </p>
  <h2>How SeLion works and the philosophy behind it.</h2>
  <p>
      SeLion uses Page Objects as a base methodology, which is commonly recommended by the Selenium community.
      In essence, don't hard-code your page element identifiers in your test cases. Build them in a way that you can
      make one change in one location, and suddenly all your test cases change with it. SeLion does this by taking a
      <a href="http://www.yaml.org">YAML</a> page definition file and turning it into a Java class you can refer to in
      your test cases. If your page element changes, the classes get regenerated. If you have multiple teams accessing
      the same classes, they don't have to change anything in their test case code. It has certainly worked for us at a
      large scale, and we don't have to re-write or maintain the base page classes.
